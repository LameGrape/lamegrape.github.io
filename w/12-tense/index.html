    <h1>The Patented&trade; epicraisin 12 tense system</h1>
    <p>copyright me right now</p>
    <br>
    <p>Tenses are constructed in a two-half system. Both halves can be past, present, or future. The first half defines a specific, singular point in time. The second half defines a range that the action is taking place in, relative to the point defined in the first half:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Past: the event happened any time prior to the time specified</li>
        <li>Future: the event happened any time proceeding the time specified</li>
        <li>Present: the event happened while the current event is happening (where the current event is defined in the first half)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If that did not help at all (very likely), this is the complete definition of each combo:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Past: the event happened at a specific point in the past</li>
        <li>Present: the event is happening at this exact moment</li>
        <li>Future: the event will happen at a specific point in the future</li>
        <li>Past Past: the event happened some time before an event in the past</li>
        <li>Past Present: the event happened while an event was happening in the past</li>
        <li>Past Future: the event happened after an event in the past (but before the present)</li>
        <li>Present Past: the event happened some time before the present</li>
        <li>Present Present: the event happened/will happen/is happening while an event is currently happening</li>
        <li>Present Future: the event will happen some time after the present</li>
        <li>Future Past: the event will happen some time before an event in the future (but after the present)</li>
        <li>Future Present: the event will happen while an event is happening in the future</li>
        <li>Future Future: the event will happen after an event happens in the future</li>
    </ul>
