    <p>The man walked across the lunar surface, a controlled yet speedy walk, for he was not one to waste time on meaningless things. If he had wanted to, he could easily sprint across the terrain. His spacesuit was not the clunky suits of those who first came here, the ones he could see in front of him. Worshippers would have wanted to come here to pray to Solaris, historians would have wanted to come here to study and honor the past. He was none of those, for he was not one to waste time in meaningless endeavours. But still, even he had some sort of reverance towards this site.</p>

    <p>He came to a stop, the decreased gravity prolonging his deceleration. The lander stood in front of him; the lower half, at least. The top half had long ago been retrievd, sat in a museum who knows where. Yet this half had been neglected, as this site was understood to be a monument, stuck in time in the first place humankind had seen where truly time can remain steady. But he didn't care the same way worshippers or historians would care, for he was not one to waste time on meaningless restrictions.</p>

    <p>His hand rest upon the golden foil of the lander, possibly to first to do so since they last left here. He walked around the lander, stopping at the ladder. Grabbing a rung, he stood where they stood. Where humankind stood. A plaque lay inside the ladder. Carefully handling it, he took it off, and carried it away from the lander.</p>

    <p>Stopping next to a tipped pole, whatever was on it long gone from centuries of exposure, he stared at the plaque. The inscription read:<br>"WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL MANKIND."<br>Dropping to his knees, he set the plaque on the surface, facing the fractured planet in the sky. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then,</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>He grieved.<br>For to him, this was not meaningless.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>He finally stood up, his eyes starting to tear. Opening them, he looked up at the planet once more. Time could not preserve it like it had this site. And before he left, he uttered,<br>"De ac vinot."</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It is done.</p>
