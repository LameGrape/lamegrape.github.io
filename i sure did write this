The building was strategically positioned in the perfect spot. Mountains surrounded it, making travel across land to reach it nearly impossible, and constant cloud cover prevented aerial reconnaissance from locating it. Communications about the location of the building are heavily censored, encrypted, and monitored, and the location is only sent remotely when absolutely necessary. Even its mere existence is shrouded in mystery and censorship, with even some of the highest ranking officials not knowing of it. It was often remarked that this tiny little building was the world's best kept secret.

But it wasn't the building that was important. It was what the building led to. Pyhtaara was not a big nation, mostly inconsequential on the world balance. They wanted to change that. So following the development of nuclear weapons by larger nations, Pyhtaara spotted an opportunity to carve their way to the top of global politics. A way to tip the scale, give them the edge. Thus the Pyhtaar Fissile Weapons Research Facility was covertly founded, a large underground complex dedicated to research, development, and testing of nuclear weaponry.

A helicopter flies through the mountains, barely above the cloud layer. Objective: disrupt and/or dismantle the Pyhtaar nuclear program.
