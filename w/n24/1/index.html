    <p>Quiet air lay motionless in the dark metal hallway, itself covered in dust all around. The only visiblity came from a dim red emergency light mounted on the wall, not likely to last much longer. There once was a time where that dust would've been swept away by a boot, or blown off by a vent's moving current. Where pure white fluorescent illuminated the halls, leaving nothing in shadow. But it is no longer that time.</p>
    <p>The first sound to pierce the centuries-long silence came from the ladder shaft at the end of the hallway. A substantial <i>*boom*</i> slightly moved some particles for the first time, shaking the floor subtlely. It sounded like a fair explosion, but not terribly big, and the deepness of the structure prevented most of the force from doing much. The second sound was that of a rusty ladder creaking under weight. Then more. Then more so. Carefully the soldiers climbed down the ladder, cautious of every rung, skipping those they deemed too unstable. On the surface, a final soldier stood next to where once was a small blast door, fittingly blasted open, as the rest slipped inwards. From the radio on his belt, he issued one message, then went in himself.</p>
    <p>"Core Recovery Team 12,  descending at 0930. Going dark."</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The team slowly pushed forward. The ultimate bottleneck to their speed was all the equipment they had to bring. Bulky radiation suits rated to many many sieverts, containers with thick lead walls, precise geiger counters. None of it was light. Luckily the faciliy was fairly small compared to the bigger silos; this one only had a single missile. They had navigated this variant of silo many times prior, and were well familiar with the layout.</p>
    <p><i>*Clunk, clunk, clunk*</i> rattled the mesh floor as the boots crossed it, covering an array of pipes. <i>*Click... click... click*</i> beeped the geiger counters, a slow reminder of the invisible monster that surrounded them. The metal walls echoed every sound, casting the once silent bunker into an audible frenzy. If anyone was in the silo at the time, they would be quite aware of the soldiers' presence. But the blast door was sealed tight; no one was in here.</p>
    <p>Flashlights waved around the corner, the barrel of a rifle always ready simultaneously. No one was in here, they were sure of that. But occassonally they were wrong; best to be thorough. Dim emergency lights still lined the walls, but the white of the flashlights far overpowered the faint red glow.</p>
    <p>Up ahead, the final door. This one would lead into the launch tube, where (unless it was somehow moved) they would find the core they were after, rocket or not. Three soldiers put down their equipment and positioned themselves by it. One used a crowbar to lever open the door, while the other two pulled back on the handle, using their legs as braces. The old locking system would have been plenty to stop this back then, but now it fell apart after enough force, and the door slammed open.</p>
    <p><i>*Cliclicliclicliclic*</i> the geiger counters droned. The core was somewhere in here.</p>
