    <p>Archived private correspondance from Kor'vi Tsar'fa to Tsi'yn Rafkilo. Sent from A'potsyn, Nor'thalin to ITA 4th Division at [EXPUNGED]. Not marked for public release.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Dear Tsi'yn,</p>
    <p>Have you heard what's going on in Lithlatsya? I'd assume you have, since you're pretty close to it. Luckily not close enough to be dragged in, so far as I know. I can't imagine things are that tranquil down south either though, what with Kri'vitsa breathing down your neck. Anyways, they haven't told us much, only that some conflict has broken out on the border, that the army is pushing in to take control of the situation, and that no citizens need be concerned. Honestly I don't see how this could possibly reach A'potsyn (we're so far away!) but my mother swore if the fighting gets anywhere close to us, she's packing up and moving us all to Akfira. Yes, she knows travel there is banned. She probably wasn't lying though.</p>
    <p>Some of the folks here are saying Kri'vitsa is preparing for war. Do you have any info on that? Again, assuming you can tell me. I just hope they don't, and if they do, that you're well and gone by then. At the same time, it seems pretty likely. They've hated Nor'thalin for a long time. Heck, they're already supporting Lithlatsya, I'm surprised they haven't been roped in already. Will any of this get past the censor? I don't know. I don't care. Every single word to and from me could be crossed out, as long as I know the paper exists.</p>
    <p>Well that's enough of that. No politics at the table, my father always says (he never reeealy means it though. He seems quite happy blathering about local government affairs). I don't really have anything else to say here-- oh wait, remember you were looking for your notebook before you had to leave? I found it under my bed. Still not sure how it got there, maybe you dropped it on the floor and it got kicked under? Whatever it is, I've got it for you when you get back. In... 22 months. Quite a long time to wait. Ignore that that means I haven't checked under my bed in two months. I'll try to keep up the pace of these letters as much as I can. I've been successful thus far, isn't that already cause for celebration? I will accept laughter by mail at your soonest convenience.</p>
