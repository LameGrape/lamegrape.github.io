    <p>The first thing that was felt was a burning coldness. For a second, this was all he was aware of; his mind had yet to process he had awoken. But once it had, every cog of his brain kicked out of its frozen rut and clicked into motion, looking for first the questions to ask, then answers to those same questions immediately after. First question: why am I so cold? And soon after, the answer: I am in a cryopod. Okay, good... next question: why am I in a cryopod? Simple as well, they put me in here. Alright, but... who is "they"?</p>
    <p>Very quickly he realized this would avalanche into endless questions, and soon he wouldn't have answers. Fortunately, the door of the cryopod rotated open, cold gasses flooding out then being swept away. He wasn't prepared for this to happen, and thus the answer to a question he hadn't even asked yet came to him. He fell forward, realized too late, and bonked his head hard against the glass of another pod, this one empty. His head throbbed; he definitely was not dreaming.</p>
    <p>After stablizing himself, he managed to feebly stand up, still quite frigid. That would go away after about 15 minutes, he recalled. He didn't quite remember why he was able to recall that, but he also recalled that memory slips were common for the same time period.</p>
    <p>The answers to all his questions would come in due time. But first, he'd like some clothes to wear.</p>

    <p>Memories flooded back into his head over those 15 minutes. By the end of those, he was comfortably warm, and most his questions had answers. Which, of course, only raised new ones. Jerome Ferentov, astrophysicist for the Centauri Research Expedition, to leave our system to study exoplanets in person. Departed 2158, so given the estimated travel time, the current year should be... 2213. Note to self, check the flight logs, they should properly account for time dilation when reporting timestamps.</p>
    <p>He obviously didn't go on this expedition alone. Where are the other crew members? The commander, the logistician, the biologist, the mechanic, the technician, he hadn't seen any of them across the entire vessel. Nor were any other cryopods occupied. There were clear signs of human presence and activity onboard, so he knew he wasn't crazy; at one point, the crew was in fact here. But not anymore. He pulled the layout of the vessel from his mind, and pathed his way to the bridge. If there were any knowledge of what happened, it would all be recorded in the flight logs.</p>
    <p>He picked a nearby terminal and sat by it. Did it still work? The fusion reactor at the back of the ship was still happily chugging along. He could tell because otherwise he'd be dead, and in more than one way. But whether the power was still going to less critical systems, like a terminal, he wasn't able to say. The power grid is programmed to cut power to such systems that aren't required to ensure the survival of the crew and the vessel while said crew is in cryostasis. A simple power saving measure, but one he couldn't be sure wasn't still on.</p>
    <p>Predictably, the terminal didn't power on. Plan B. He located the closest pocket terminal, sat on the navigator's desk, then looked for a wrench. Finding none immediately surrounding him, he drudged up the whereabouts of a maitenance cubby just across the hallway. A quick trip to and back, wrench in hand, he had all he needed. At the center of the bridge was an island, and at the back of that island was a panel. The wrench made quick work of the panel's bolts, revealing the precious blackbox within. This box held all the flight data, and could withstand the entire vessel crashing into Earth from orbit without breaking open.</p>
    <p>A port on the blackbox let him connect the pocket terminal and access the data within. After a few sanity checks to ensure the system was working correctly, he sent a command to return the current time.</p>
